The arm is assembled from a cheap kit I bought on eBay and itâ€™s connected to an Ardunio micro-controller. The Arduino is running a sketch that allows me to set the angles of each of the servos by sending commands over the USB connection. A sketch written in Processing is running on the connected laptop. The sketch has sliders that allow me to set the the angles on each of the servos. Additionally I use a leap motion to allow me to control the robot arm using intuitive hand gestures.
